This is my first attempt at creating a machine learning algorithm. This will predict whether you should buy, force buy or eco depending on your money, your opponent's money, the round number, and the money earned in the previous round. This will draw from data at the CSGO database https://csgo-stats.com/matches and correspondingly adjust its views. 

Scrapes data successfully, but the economy is busted on the website, preventing any sort of actual analysis into whether you should buy or not. Thought about converting to money spent vs opponent's money spent and predicting round win/loss, but that fails to deliver any meaningful info, especially as it would just reflect the probabilities of winning with that certain buy.
