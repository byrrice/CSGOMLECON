This is my first attempt at creating a machine learning algorithm. This will predict whether you should buy, force buy or eco depending on your money, your opponent's money, the round number, and the money earned in the previous round. This will draw from data at the CSGO database https://csgo-stats.com/matches and correspondingly adjust its views. Hopefully should be up at the end of summer.
